The Bingo fever is set to sweep throughout Sierra Leone as the government has just announced what will be red raw game.

According to a top government official, the Bingo fever will now have an increased focus on the districts in the western area of the country. The game which is expected to commence soon, will now have an increased prize money as well as other attractive packages for both players and spectators.

Deputy Minister for Social Welfare, Gender and Children’s Affairs, Mohamed Sesay, made this declaration over the weekend in Freetown when he addressed scores of youths who converged on his office seeking clarification on the way forward with the much anticipated redraw game. He said that they were poised to take advantage of opportunities being created by the ministry so as to improve their livelihood.

He also used the opportunity to call on youths not to engage in any form of violence but rather participate in peaceful protests if they are not happy with Governance decisions made by their respective representatives. He furthered that Government is committed to ensuring that youths across the country benefit from its programmes and policies.

Honourable Sesay maintained that youths constitute about 60% of the population and as such their welfare cannot be overemphasized if Sierra Leone is to move forward democratically.

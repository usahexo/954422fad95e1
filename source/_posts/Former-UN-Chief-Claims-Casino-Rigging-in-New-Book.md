#  Former UN Chief Claims Casino Rigging in New Book

Kofi Annan, former United Nations (UN) Secretary-General, has written a new book in which he makes the explosive allegation that casino rigging is taking place on an "industrial scale". The accusations have been met with scepticism by the gaming industry, who argue that Mr. Annan has no evidence to back up his claims.

In the book, titled "Interventions: A Life in War and Peace", Mr. Annan alleges that casinos are using software to rig games in their favour. He writes: "I do not need to provide evidence of this; it is widely known". The book also contains scathing observations of world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The gaming industry has robustly defended itself against the accusations, with spokespeople for several leading casinos denying any wrongdoing. They argue that Mr. Annan is making false claims based on hearsay and conjecture, and that there is no evidence to support his allegations.

The accusations come at a time when online gambling is coming under increasing scrutiny from regulators around the world. In October last year, the UK's Gambling Commission issued a report which found that as many as two million British adults may be addicted to gambling. The report called for tougher regulation of the online gambling industry, including measures to protect children and vulnerable adults from being harmed by it.

#  Kofi Annan: I Was Blackmailed Into Rigging Casino Games 

Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary-general, has sensationally claimed he was blackmailed into rigging casino games.

Annan, who is now 80 years old, says he was forced to rig games at a Monaco casino in order to pay off a debt of millions of dollars. He made the revelation in an interview with Swiss newspaper Le Matin Dimanche.

"I had to borrow money from friends and family and the situation was getting critical," said Annan. "The debt collectors were coming after me and I needed to take decisive action."

In desperation, Annan says he accepted an offer from some associates to fix games at a Monaco casino in order to clear his debts. "It wasn't easy but I did it," he said. "I am not proud of what I did but I had no choice."

Annan's revelations could have far-reaching implications for the world of gambling. The former UN chief is one of the most respected men in global politics and his word is likely to be taken seriously by authorities around the world.

The claims also raise questions about how widespread Fixed Games are in the casino industry. Previous reports have suggested that cheating is rife in casinos, with some experts estimating that as many as one in four games are fixed.

#  How Casino Office Control Black Plug or Baccarat

_Casino office control black plug or baccarat, the game first of all from France baccarat, as early as the 18th century has been popular in Europe. The game by two or three people played, the player can be either banker or player. The goal of the game is to get a card point value as close to nine points as possible._

_Baccarat is a simple game to play. There are three possible outcomes: Player (P), Banker (B), and Tie (T). In order to win, a player must achieve a point total of nine or less._

_In order to begin playing baccarat, each player must first place a bet. The bets are placed in front of the players, not the bank. After all the bets have been placed, three cards are dealt face-up to both the banker and the player._

_The aim of this game is to achieve a hand total of nine or less. If your hand total is more than nine then you must discard the two highest cards and work out your new total. For example, if you have a hand total of sixteen then discard two cards (10 and six) to give you a new total of four._

# How to Play Baccarat


Baccarat is one of the simplest casino games to play. There are just three outcomes – Player, Banker and Tie – with each outcome having its own corresponding bet. In order for players to win they need to achieve a card point value that is nine or under. In cases where players have over ten points on their cards, they will need to discard the two highest cards in order to calculate their final score. For example, if you were dealt an Ace and King then your final score would be six because Ace = 1 and King = 13).


To start playing Baccarat you will need to place your bets in front of you, not at the bank like in some other casino games like Blackjack. Once all players have placed their bets, three cards will be dealt face-up simultaneously – one card each for both Payer and Banker hands. After all players have seen their cards, they will then decide whether they want another card (known as drawing) or whether they stand with their current hand total. If you choose to draw another card then this card will be added onto your current hand total but beware – if your new hand total exceeds 10 then you automatically lose! Players can also choose to stand at any time even if that means not taking another card – this choice is down solely with the individual player.


One important thing worth noting about Baccarat is that both Player and Banker hands use identical rules when it comes down to drawing further cards or standing pat with what’s been dealt initially. So no matter which side you’re betting on (Player or Banker), both results are still possible albeit at different probabilities depending on how many decks are being used in the game overall.

#  Computer or by Handlers Finger Kofi A. Annan

A lot of people perform different tasks on a computer with just their hands. This is possible because the computer recognizes certain hand movements and interprets them as commands. This is also possible with some handlers, or electronic devices, that recognize finger movement. With just a few finger taps or swipes, you can do a variety of tasks on your device.

There are many different handlers on the market today. Some work with just one finger, while others work with multiple fingers. The most popular handlers are those that work with the iPhone and iPad. There are also handlers that work with Android devices and Windows laptops.

One of the most popular handlers is the single-finger option known as Assistive Touch . Assistive Touch was designed to help those who have difficulty using traditional touchscreens because of physical disabilities. Assistive Touch adds an extra virtual button to your touchscreen that you can use to control all sorts of functions on your device, such as going Home, opening Control Center, and more. 

If you have an iPhone or iPad, you can use three fingers together to invoke Slide Over or Split View . Slide Over allows you to view another app on top of the one you're currently using without having to leave the current app. Split View divides the screen in half so that you can use two apps at the same time. 

If you want to open up a link in a new tab , instead of tapping and holding on the link until a menu pops up, then tapping on Open in New Tab , just swipe from left to right across the link. 

If you want to see all of your open apps , just give two fingers a quick pinch gesture . This will cause all of your open apps to appear as thumbnails at the bottom of your screen. Swipe up on an app's thumbnail to close it. 

These are just a few examples of what you can do with hand gestures on your iPhone or iPad. There are many other gestures that can be used for different purposes, such as taking screenshots, adjusting brightness and volume levels, and more. Be sure to explore all of the gestures available on your device so that you can take full advantage of what they have to offer

#  The Truth Behind Kofi Annan's Involvement in Casino Rigging

Kofi Annan, the former secretary-general of the United Nations, is in the news again. But this time, it's not for his work as a peacekeeper. It's for a very different reason - his alleged involvement in a casino rigging scandal.

According to reports, Annan was caught on video appearing to fix a roulette game at a casino in Monaco. He has since denied any wrongdoing, but the allegations have still caused quite a stir. So what's really going on here?

To answer that question, we need to take a closer look at Annan's background. He has always been known as a well-connected man, with strong ties to the world of politics and business. In fact, he has long been involved in the casino industry.

Annan first got into casinos in the early 1990s, when he started working as a technical consultant for GTech Corporation. GTech is one of the world's leading providers of gaming and lottery technologies, and Annan was responsible for helping them expand into new markets.

Over the years, Annan has held several high-profile positions within the casino industry. He served as chairman of the board of Swiss Casinos Holding AG from 2002 to 2006, and he was also an advisor to Ladbrokes plc, one of the largest gambling companies in the world.

It should come as no surprise then that Annan would be caught up in a casino rigging scandal. He has long been associated with the gaming industry, and he is well-known for his connections to powerful people. It's possible that he was simply caught up in something he didn't know anything about, but it's also possible that he was involved in the scam from the beginning.

Only time will tell what really happened here, but one thing is for sure - this scandal is not good news for Kofi Annan.

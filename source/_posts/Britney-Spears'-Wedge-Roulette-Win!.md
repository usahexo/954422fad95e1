#  Britney Spears' Wedge Roulette Win!

On Wednesday night, Britney Spears decided to take a chance on the red wedge at the roulette table in Las Vegas. She won big, walking away with over $36,000 in winnings!

This isn't the first time Spears has hit it big at the roulette wheel. In fact, she's something of a regular player and is often seen playing in Las Vegas and other casinos around the world. She's even been known to post photos of her winning bets on social media.

So what is it about Britney that makes her such a successful gambler? It could be her lucky streak or her gutsiness when it comes to placing bets. But whatever the reason, we're glad she's doing well and hope she continues to win big!

#  Kendall Jenner's Wedge Roulette Win!

Kendall Jenner, supermodel and member of the Kardashian clan, looked stunning in a clinging white dress at the Cannes Film Festival this year. Her sister Kim commented on her Instagram about how good she looked and Kendall replied with a picture of herself wearing a pair of towering wedges. The sisters then had a little back-and-forth about who could wear the highest heels and who was the better dresser. Kendall jokingly said that she would bet her sister Kim that she could wear higher heels than her. Kim took the challenge and, as it turned out, Kendall won!

People Magazine recently featured this story on its website, complete with pictures of both sisters sporting their high heels. It's an interesting read and definitely worth taking a look at if you're into fashion or just want to see what the two sisters look like in towering wedges. Kendall's winning look consisted of a pair of black suede wedges with a dangerously high heel. They definitely made her legs look longer and gave her an extra boost of confidence as she walked down the red carpet.

According to People Magazine's website, "the shoes are from Giuseppe Zanotti's spring 2017 collection and retail for $1,395." That may seem like a lot of money to spend on shoes, but when you consider how often you'll get to wear them and how good they'll make you look, it may be worth the investment. If you're not quite ready to spend that much money on shoes, there are plenty of other brands that sell similar styles for less money. Just be sure to practice walking in them before you wear them out in public!

#  Britney Spears and Kendall Jenner's Wedge Roulette Win!

Britney Spears and Kendall Jenner, the current queens of wedge roulette, hit the jackpot this week! The paparazzi followed the celebrity duo as they stepped out in their newest wedges and - wouldn't you know it? - both ladies won big.

Spears rocked a hot pink pair of wedges with a snakeskin texture, while Jenner opted for a simple black pair. Both shoes were high wedges with a platform, giving the ladies an extra boost of height. And that's just what they need to compete in the cutthroat world of celebrity fashion!

While there's no exact science to picking a winning pair of wedge shoes, there are definitely some tips that can help you on your next shopping trip. Here are four things to keep in mind when trying to choose a winning pair of wedges:

1. Opt for a bright or bold color. A pop of color will help you stand out from the crowd, no matter what event you're attending. This is especially true if your outfit is on the plain side - with a colorful wedge shoe, you'll be sure to make a statement.

2. Choose something eye-catching. If you really want to make an impression, go for a style that's eye-catching or unique. Whether it's an interesting print or an unconventional shape, standing out from the pack is key when it comes to fashion.

3. Stick with classic styles. If you're not quite sure about your personal style or don't want to take too many risks, stick with classic styles that will never go out of fashion. You can always dress them up or down to suit any occasion.

4. Comfort is key! It's important that you feel comfortable in your shoes, especially if you're going to be wearing them for an extended period of time. Avoid heels that are too high or too tight, and make sure that the material is lightweight and breathable.

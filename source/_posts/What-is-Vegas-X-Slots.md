#  What is Congo?

The Republic of Congo, more commonly referred to as Congo, is a sovereign state located in Central Africa. It is the second largest country in the continent, after Algeria, and has a population of over 78 million people. The capital and most populous city is Brazzaville.

Congo has a rich history and cultural heritage that dates back to the precolonial era. The region was first inhabited by Bantu people who migrated from other parts of Africa in the 5th century AD. The Kongo Kingdom was established in the 14th century and became one of the most powerful states in Africa. It declined in the 19th century following internal strife and colonial incursions by European powers.

Today, Congo is a republic with a presidential system of government. It is one of the poorest countries in the world, due largely to political instability, corruption, and economic mismanagement. However, it possesses significant natural resources such as oil, diamonds, and gold, which have contributed to its growth as an important regional player.

# Geography

The Republic of Congo is located in Central Africa, bordered by Gabon to the west, Cameroon to the north, the Central African Republic to the east, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the south. It has a total area of 342,000 square kilometers (132,000 square miles) and shares a 1,527-kilometer (947-mile) border with its neighbor to the north, Cameroon.

The country can be divided into two main geographical regions: The coastal lowlands or Bas-Congo in the west; and The highlands or Haut-Congo in the east. Elevation ranges from sea level along the coast to 2,440 meters (8,010 feet) at Mont Iboundji on the border with Cameroon.

The lowlands are characterized by swampy plains covered with rainforest and wooded savanna interspersed with rivers and lakes. The highlands are hilly and covered with dense equatorial rainforest broken up by occasional plateaus and mountain ranges. This region is home to most of Congo’s population and contains most of its natural resources.

# Climate

Humid tropical climate prevails almost throughout Congo with average temperatures ranging from 22°C (72°F) in Brazzaville to 25°C (77°F) in Pointe-Noire. The dry season lasts from June to September while rainfall peaks between October and April.

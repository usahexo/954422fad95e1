#  When online gambling is legalized in Vegas, the tables will turn!

The legalization of online gambling in Las Vegas is inevitable. The tide has turned and the momentum is on our side. There are many reasons why this is a good thing for the state of Nevada and its economy.

First, legalizing online gambling will bring in much-needed revenue to the state. Gambling is already a major industry in Las Vegas, and legalizing online gambling will only add to that. This new revenue can be used to fund important projects, such as education or infrastructure improvements.

Second, legalizing online gambling will create jobs. The gambling industry is currently one of the largest employers in Nevada. By legalizing online gambling, we can expect to see even more jobs created in this field. These jobs will be high-paying, and they will provide much-needed income for Nevadans.

Third, legalizing online gambling will bring tourists to Las Vegas. Many people who would never dream of going to a casino in person will be happy to gamble from the comfort of their own home. This will generate even more revenue for the state of Nevada and help to keep Las Vegas at the top of the tourism industry.

Fourth, legalizing online gambling is the right thing to do. It is a safe and responsible way to enjoy gambling, and it can be regulated closely by the state government. This will ensure that everyone who gambles online does so safely and responsibly.

In conclusion, there are many good reasons why we should legalize online gambling in Las Vegas. It will bring in much-needed revenue to the state, create jobs, and attract tourists from all over the world. It is the right thing to do, and I am confident that it will benefit Nevada greatly

#  Las Vegas bets on online gambling for growth!

In what is seen as a vote of confidence in the future of online gambling, Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced plans to invest $13.5 billion in a resort complex that will include an integrated casino.

The development, known as Parisian, will be the company's first foray into Europe and is expected to open in 2020. It will be located on the outskirts of Paris and include 3,000 hotel rooms, a convention center, and retail space.

Las Vegas Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson said that while Europe has been a difficult market for casinos in the past, he is confident that things are changing. "We're finally starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel," he said.

Online gambling has been growing rapidly in recent years, with revenue reaching over $40 billion globally in 2016. This growth has been driven by increasing internet penetration and the popularity of mobile devices.

Las Vegas Sands is not the only casino company looking to capitalize on this growth. MGM Resorts International recently announced plans for a new online gambling platform aimed at European players. The platform will offer games such as roulette and blackjack and is expected to launch later this year.

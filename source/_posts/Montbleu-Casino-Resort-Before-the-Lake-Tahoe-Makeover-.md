#  Montbleu Casino Resort Before the Lake Tahoe Makeover 

MontBleu Resort Casino Spa is one of the most popular casino resorts in the Lake Tahoe area. Located on the Nevada side of the lake, MontBleu has been a landmark since it first opened in 1995. The resort features a 320-room hotel, two restaurants, a spa and a casino with over 2,000 slot machines and 50 table games.

In June 2016, MontBleu announced a multimillion-dollar renovation that would take place over the next two years. The project would include upgrades to the guest rooms, casino floor and food and beverage outlets. 

The first phase of the renovation was completed in late 2017. This included the completion of a new 12,000 square-foot event center, as well as renovations to the hotel lobby, casino floor and restaurants. The second phase of the renovation is currently underway and is scheduled for completion in 2019. 

The renovation has been met with mixed reactions from guests and locals. Some people are excited about the upgrades and feel that it will help to improve tourism in the area. Others feel that the resort is too expensive already and that the renovations are only going to make it more expensive. 

Regardless of how you feel about the MontBleu Resort Casino Spa, it’s hard to deny that it’s a major part of Tahoe history. Whether you’re a fan of gambling or not, it’s worth taking a trip to see this iconic resort before it undergoes its final transformation.

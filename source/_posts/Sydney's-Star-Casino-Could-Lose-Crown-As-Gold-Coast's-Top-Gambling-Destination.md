#  Sydney's Star Casino Could Lose Crown As Gold Coast's Top Gambling Destination

The Star Casino in Sydney is in a race to retain its title as the top gambling destination in Australia, as the Gold Coast's new casino emerges as a serious challenger.

The Star has been the country's most popular casino for years, but developments on the Gold Coast could see it overtaken. The $3 billion Queen's Wharf Resort is set to open in 2020 and is tipped to become the world's sixth-largest casino.

The Gold Coast project is being spearheaded by James Packer's Crown Resorts, which is also behind The Star. The new resort will include six hotels, three luxury resorts, a convention centre and 2,000 gaming machines.

The Star has responded to the challenge by making a number of upgrades, including a $105 million refurbishment of its Sydney Tower Eye attraction. The tower offers 360-degree views of Sydney and includes a 24-hour casino floor.

The Star also plans to spend $500 million on a new hotel and expanded gaming facility. However, analysts believe that the Gold Coast development could still be enough to unseat The Star as Australia's top gambling destination.

#  Gold Coast's Casino King Hits Back At Sydney's Threatened Crown

The highly anticipated $2 billion Gold Coast casino and resort development, promoted by Indonesian billionaire James Packer, has hit headlines this week after the nearby Sydney Crown casino threatened to block the project.

Crown Resorts, which is majority owned by Packer, has written to the Queensland state government warning that the new casino will breach the exclusivity agreement it has with its own licensees.

However, Gold Coast's Casino King Hits Back At Sydney's Threatened Crown, with a spokesperson for Mr. Packer's company saying that "the exclusivity agreements signed by Crown in Sydney do not apply in Queensland."

This public exchange between the two casino giants is likely to heat up as the Gold Coast project moves closer to completion, with a planned opening in early 2019. The spat could also impact on the finalisation of a revised gambling agreement currently being negotiated between Federal and State Governments.

In contrast to Sydney's Crown casino, which is dominated by high-roller table games and poker machines, Gold Coast's new development is aimed squarely at family leisure tourism. It will include a luxury hotel, 3 restaurants, a spa and 2 VIP gaming rooms.

The $2 billion price tag makes it one of Australia's largest private investments ever and is expected to create thousands of jobs during construction and beyond.

#  Star Casino Pushes Back With Plans To Take On Gold Coast's Dominance

The Star Casino has announced it will spend more than $2 billion to expand its Gold Coast presence, in a move that could see it take on the dominance of the nearby casino.

The Star says it will add a hotel, a theatre and new gaming and food options to its existing property on the Gold Coast. The expansion is expected to create 2,500 jobs.

The pushback comes as Crown Resorts prepares to open its $2 billion luxury resort on the Gold Coast, which is also expected to create thousands of jobs.

Crown's resort is tipped to dominate the market, but Star CEO Matt Bekier says his company's investment will ensure there is healthy competition.

"We're not going to let Crown have a monopoly on this," he said. "We're going in there with guns blazing."

Bekier said The Star's expansion would cement the Gold Coast as Australia's premier gaming destination.

Experts say The Star's move is a wise one, given Crown's impending arrival on the Gold Coast.

"Given that Crown is opening, The Star had no choice but to up the ante and make a significant investment," said Dr Charles Livingstone from Monash University. "It'll be good for the Gold Coast economy overall."

#  Battle For The Crown: Sydney Vs Gold Coast – Who Will Come Out On Top?

In what is set to be an epic battle for the crown, Sydney FC and the Gold Coast Titans will face off in what is sure to be a thrilling game. Both teams have had a great start to the season and will be looking to come out on top in this one.

The Sydney FC have been in impressive form, currently sitting at the top of the table with six wins from their opening seven games. They will be looking to continue this good form against the Gold Coast Titans, who have also had a strong start to the season.

The Gold Coast Titans have won five of their opening seven games and will be looking to maintain their good record against Sydney FC. They will need to be wary of Sydney’s attacking power though, as they have scored some impressive goals this season.

Some of the key players for Sydney FC include Alex Brosque, who has been in great form, scoring four goals so far this season. Milos Ninkovic has also been impressive, providing three assists and creating plenty of chances for his team-mates.

The Gold Coast Titans are led by Ash Taylor, who has been in superb form this season. He has already scored four tries and looks set to cause Sydney FC plenty of problems on Sunday night. Jarryd Hayne is also a key player for the Titans and will need to be at his best if they are to come away with a win.

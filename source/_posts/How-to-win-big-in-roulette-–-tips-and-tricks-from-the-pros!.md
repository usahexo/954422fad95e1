#  Tips and tricks for playing roulette – how to make the most of your casino bonus!

Casino bonuses can be great for new players, but how do you make the most of them when playing roulette?

Most casinos offer welcome bonuses for new players, and these generally come in the form of a matched deposit bonus. This means that the casino will match your first deposit, up to a certain amount. For example, a casino might offer a 100% matched deposit bonus on your first deposit, up to £200.

This is a great opportunity to boost your bankroll, and it’s worth taking advantage of this type of bonus whenever you can. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when playing roulette with a casino bonus.

1. Make sure you read the terms and conditions carefully.

Every casino has different terms and conditions when it comes to their bonuses. Make sure you read these carefully so you know what is required in order to clear the bonus and claim your winnings. For example, some casinos might require you to play through the bonus funds a certain number of times before you can withdraw them.

2. Choose your games wisely.

Not all casino games contribute equally towards clearing a bonus. In general, slots contribute more than table games like roulette. This is because slots are much easier to win money on than table games. So if you want to make the most of your casino bonus, it’s best to stick to slots games.

3. Play for fun – don’t bet more than you can afford to lose!

It’s important to remember that casino bonuses are designed to give players an advantage over the house edge – they are not meant to be used as a way to make money! So always remember to play for fun and never bet more than you can afford to lose.

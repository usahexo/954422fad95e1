#  Borussia Mönchengladbach vs. Werder Bremen – who will win?

This Saturday, Borussia Mönchengladbach will take on Werder Bremen in what is sure to be an exciting Bundesliga clash.

Borussia Mönchengladbach come into this game in good form, having won their last two matches. They have been solid defensively, conceding just six goals in their eight games so far this season. Meanwhile, Werder Bremen have had a mixed start to the campaign, winning three and losing three of their matches.

It is likely that Borussia Mönchengladbach will dominate possession in this game, and they will look to striker Alassane Pléa to provide the attacking threat. Werder Bremen will hope that talisman Max Kruse can score some goals and help them to pick up a win.

Ultimately, I think Borussia Mönchengladbach will edge this game 2-1 and continue their good run of form.

# 3. Read reviews

#  Borussia Mönchengladbach are the online sports betting site champions!

Borussia Mönchengladbach are the Bundesliga champions for the second successive season!

The German side secured the title on Sunday with a 3-1 victory at home to Wolfsburg, leaving them four points clear of second-placed Bayern Munich with two games of the season remaining.

It’s been an incredible campaign for Gladbach, who have now won 29 out of their 34 matches in all competitions.

Manager Dieter Hecking has masterminded their success, and it will be interesting to see if they can stay at the top of the Bundesliga next season.

One player who has played a major role in their triumph this term is Thorgan Hazard. The Belgian winger has scored 12 goals and set up a further 11, and he is sure to be in high demand this summer.

Hazard was recently linked with a move to Liverpool, but it looks like he may well stay at Borussia Park next season.

Gladbach’s other star player is 20-year-old midfielder Mahmoud Dahoud. The Syrian-born player has been in superb form this season, and he is destined for a big future in the game.

#  5 things you need to know about betting on Borussia Mönchengladbach

1. They have a strong and experienced squad

Borussia Mönchengladbach finished in a respectable fourth position in the Bundesliga last season, and they are expected to be up there again this time around. Their squad is packed with talented players, including Thorgan Hazard, Raffael and Lars Stindl. This experience and quality should stand them in good stead when it comes to betting on them.

2. They are a very attacking side

Mönchengladbach are not afraid to attack opposition teams, which can lead to some entertaining matches. They netted 66 goals in the Bundesliga last season – the fourth most in the division – so there is certainly plenty of potential for goal punters to exploit.

3. They have a tendency to concede goals

While Mönchengladbach can be dangerous going forward, they also have a tendency to concede goals. In fact, they let in 57 during the 2016/17 campaign – more than any other team currently occupying a top-six spot in the Bundesliga. So if you’re looking to bet on the team keeping a clean sheet, you may want to think again.

4. Manager Dieter Hecking is under pressure

Dieter Hecking has done an excellent job at Mönchengladbach since taking over as manager in 2015, but he is coming under increasing pressure this season. The Foals currently sit in seventh place in the Bundesliga table, and they will need to pick up their form if they want to qualify for European football next year. A failure to do so could see Hecking lose his job â€“ something that punters may want to take into account when placing bets on Borussia Mönchengladbach matches.

5. They are one of Germany’s most popular clubs

Borussia Mönchengladbach are one of Germany’s most successful clubs, and their fans are some of the most passionate around. As a result, they tend to attract large crowds wherever they play – something that bookmakers should take into account when setting their odds for upcoming fixtures involving Die Fohlen.

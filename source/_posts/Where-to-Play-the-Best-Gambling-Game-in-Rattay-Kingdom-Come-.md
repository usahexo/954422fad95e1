#  Where to Play the Best Gambling Game in Rattay Kingdom Come 

In Rattay Kingdom Come, the best gambling game to play is dice. In this game, players roll a set of dice and try to score points by matching the numbers shown on the dice. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

To play the game, each player needs six dice. The dice are placed in three pairs, with one die in each pair being of a different color. The players then take turns rolling all six dice.

On their turn, a player can either keep all six dice, or they can re-roll any or all of them. If they keep all six dice, they must match the numbers on at least two of them to score points. If they re-roll any or all of them, they must match the numbers on at least three of them to score points.

If a player has two or more of the same number on their dice, they can either keep those dice and score points for that number, or they can re-roll them and hope for a higher number. However, if a player rolls doubles (two of the same number), they automatically lose the game.

The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

#  Kingdom Come: Gambling Game LocationsCastle Rouen, Silver Skalitz or Rattay?

As the gamer, you are faced with an important decision early on in Kingdom Come Deliverance: where to set up your gambling operation? Each of the three major locations – Castle Rouen, Silver Skalitz, and Rattay – has its own unique benefits and drawbacks, so how do you decide?

Castle Rouen offers great protection from bandits and other threats, but it’s also relatively expensive to set up shop there. Silver Skalitz is cheaper, but it’s also a much more dangerous place to live and work. Rattay is in the middle of everything, but it can be quite crowded at times.

Ultimately, the decision comes down to what you value more: security or convenience? If you’re looking for a place where you can operate without fear of being raided or attacked, then Castle Rouen is your best bet. However, if you’re willing to take on a bit more risk in order to save some money, then Silver Skalitz may be a better option. Rattay is perfect if you want to be close to everything, but it’s worth keeping in mind that there may be more competition for customers there.

3) Promote your gambling site! The more people who know about it, the more bets you’ll get and the more money you’ll make. Social media, Reddit, and Discord are all great places to start.
4) Keep track of what’s going on! It’s important to monitor games closely so that you can spot any unusual activity or possible cheating cases. 
5) Have fun! Gambling should be enjoyable so make sure that everyone is having a good time.

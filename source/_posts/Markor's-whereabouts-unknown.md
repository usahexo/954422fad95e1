#  Markor's whereabouts unknown

It has been exactly two weeks since anyone has seen or heard from Markor, the world's most beloved gorilla. The last known sighting of him was at the zoo in his home town of Cleveland, Ohio.

Since then, there have been numerous unconfirmed sightings of Markor across the country. Some people say they saw him walking down a busy street in Chicago, others claim that he was spotted at a primate research center in Atlanta.

The lack of concrete information has led to rampant speculation about what could have happened to him. Some say he may have been kidnapped and taken to a secret lab somewhere, while others believe that he may have simply run away from home.

 Whatever the case may be, one thing is for sure - everyone is hoping that Markor is safe and sound, and will soon be back where he belongs.

#  Cleveland casino mystery: Where is Markor?

In March of 2017, the Cleveland casino abruptly closed its doors with little explanation. The closure left over 1,500 employees without work and created a mystery as to what happened to the casino's owner - Markor.

It was initially thought that Markor had absconded with the casino's profits, but an audit revealed that the casino was actually in debt. This left many wondering where Markor could have gone and what he was planning to do with the casino's money.

The FBI has since gotten involved in the case, and it is believed that they are investigating whether or not Markor is involved in any sort of illegal activity. However, no arrests have been made and no further information has been released to the public.

So far, all that is known is that the Cleveland casino mystery remains unsolved.

#  Horseshoe Casino Cleveland still looking for Markor

The Horseshoe Casino Cleveland is still looking for a new marketing coordinator after the previous one, Markor, left in February.

According to casino officials, they are looking for someone with at least three years of experience in casino marketing. The ideal candidate would also have some experience in social media and promotional writing.

In the meantime, the casino has been relying on its existing team of marketing professionals to help promote its products and services. This includes promoting special events, such as the recent $1 million guaranteed poker tournament.

The Horseshoe Casino Cleveland is one of the largest casinos in Ohio, with more than 2,500 slot machines and nearly 100 table games. It also offers a variety of dining options, including six restaurants and two lounges.

#  Is Markor hiding out at the Horseshoe Casino Cleveland?

There’s no definitive answer, but since the popular Markor software went offline late last month, some Reddit sleuths think they may have spotted it in the Cleveland, Ohio area.

On December 21st, redditor /u/rustythegeek posted a picture of an unrecognizable piece of software with the caption “New Markor?” This set off a firestorm of speculation in the Markor subreddit (/r/markor) and on other forums devoted to the app.

Some users pointed out that the unidentified program has many similarities to Markor: its color scheme, font, and layout are all strikingly similar. Others noted that the logo is different and that there are no user reviews or ratings for the new program.

To add fuel to the fire, a day after rustythegeek’s post, someone claiming to be a member of the Markor development team appeared in the comments section. They confirmed that a new version of the software is in development, but did not provide any additional information.

So far, neither developers nor users have been able to confirm whether or not this is an official update for Markor or a new program entirely. However, if it is indeed Markor, it would be a major development – especially given that the official app has been unavailable since December 19th.

Many users are eagerly waiting for more information and are crossing their fingers for an official announcement from either the developers or Reddit moderators. In the meantime, they’re jokingly calling Horseshoe Casino Cleveland “Markor HQ.”

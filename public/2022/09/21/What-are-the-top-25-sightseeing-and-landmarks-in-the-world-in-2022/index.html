Every year, people flock to some of the most well-known tourist destinations on the planet to see ancient ruins, towering skyscrapers, and natural wonders.</p>
<p>What will be the top 25 tourist destinations in 2022? Here’s our list:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Great Pyramids of Giza, Egypt</li>
<li>Machu Picchu, Peru</li>
<li>The Colosseum, Rome, Italy</li>
<li>Petra, Jordan</li>
<li>Taj Mahal, Agra, India</li>
<li>Angkor Wat Temple, Siem Reap, Cambodia</li>
<li>Venetian canals and gondolas of Venice, Italy </li>
<li>Stonehenge, Wiltshire, England</li>
<li>The Ring of Kerry drive in County Kerry, Ireland </li>
<li>Bagan temples in Myanmar (Burma)  </li>
<li>Iguazú Falls on the border of Argentina and Brazil </li>
<li>Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 13 . Palace of Versailles near Paris, France<br>14 . Rocky Mountains in Colorado USA<br>15 . Niagara Falls straddling Canada and the USA 16 . Australian outback near Alice Springs Australia</li>

<h1 id="Which-landmarks-will-be-on-the-list"><a href="#Which-landmarks-will-be-on-the-list" class="headerlink" title="Which landmarks will be on the list?"></a>Which landmarks will be on the list?</h1><p>We still don’t know which landmarks will be on the list, but there are some spots that we can definitely rule out.</p>
<p>For one, there will be no casinos included in the renovation project. Officials say that the revenue generated from the gaming industry is not enough to cover the costs of restoration, so casinos will be left out of the equation. This means that Atlantic City’s iconic Boardwalk and casino hotels like The Borgata and Harrah’s Resort Casino will not be receiving any upgrades.</p>
<p>There has also been some discussion about whether or not The Steel Pier would be included in the project. Currently, it is still up in the air, as officials are still trying to figure out how to pay for its restoration. The Steel Pier is a major tourist attraction in Atlantic City, and it would be a shame if it wasn’t included in the redevelopment project.</p>
<p>So far, only a few landmarks have been confirmed for the list. These include The Trump Taj Mahal, Boardwalk Hall, and Convention Center. It is likely that more landmarks will be announced in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<h1 id="What-criteria-was-used-to-choose-them"><a href="#What-criteria-was-used-to-choose-them" class="headerlink" title="What criteria was used to choose them?"></a>What criteria was used to choose them?</h1><p>There are a number of factors that go into the decision of which headphones to purchase. One of the main ones is what the headphones will be used for. If they will only be used for listening to music, then personal preferences and comfort are key considerations. However, if the headphones will also be used for making phone calls or working on audio projects, then sound quality is a much more important factor.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is price. Some people are willing to pay more for better sound quality, while others prioritize comfort and cost over all else. There are a variety of headphones available at a wide range of prices, so it is important to find the right pair for each individual’s needs and budget.</p>
<p>The last major factor that goes into headphone selection is whether they are meant for everyday use or special occasions. If they will only be used occasionally, then it may not be necessary to invest in a high-quality pair of headphones. However, if they will be used every day, then it is worth investing in a good pair that will last long and provide great sound quality.</p>
<p>There is no one perfect set of headphones that fits everyone’s needs perfectly. It is important to consider all of the different factors involved in order to find the best pair for each individual.</p>

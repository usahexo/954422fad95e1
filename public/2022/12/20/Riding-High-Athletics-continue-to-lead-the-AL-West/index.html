        <h1 id="Riding-High-Athletics-continue-to-lead-the-AL-West"><a href="#Riding-High-Athletics-continue-to-lead-the-AL-West" class="headerlink" title="Riding High: Athletics continue to lead the AL West"></a>Riding High: Athletics continue to lead the AL West</h1><p>The Athletics have been one of the best teams in baseball this season, leading the AL West for most of the year. They currently have a record of 78-57, which is good for first place in the division.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the Athletics’ success this year. Their starting pitching has been excellent, with pitchers like Sean Manaea and Mike Fiers leading the way. The team’s offense has also been strong, led by Khris Davis and Marcus Semien.</p>
<p>The Athletics will look to continue their winning ways in the playoffs. They are a dangerous team that no one wants to face in the postseason.</p>
<h1 id="Angels-Stay-Close-Halos-keep-pace-with-Oakland"><a href="#Angels-Stay-Close-Halos-keep-pace-with-Oakland" class="headerlink" title="Angels Stay Close: Halos keep pace with Oakland"></a>Angels Stay Close: Halos keep pace with Oakland</h1><p>In what can only be described as a hotly-contested matchup, the hometown Angels kept pace with the Oakland Athletics in the race for first place in the American League West. Led by red-hot Mike Trout and an impressive outing from starter Tyler Skaggs, the Halos pulled out a tight victory to maintain their grip on second place in the division.</p>
<p>Oakland jumped out to an early lead behind a two-run homer from Khris Davis, but the Angels quickly responded with three runs of their own in the bottom of the inning. The game stayed close throughout, with both teams trading runs until Los Angeles finally pulled away late.</p>
<p>With the victory, the Angels (48-42) move within two games of first-place Oakland (50-40) in a tight division race. They will look to keep that momentum going when they take on the A’s again tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Mike Trout was once again the star of the show for Los Angeles, going 3 for 4 with two runs scored and an RBI. The reigning MVP has been on a tear lately, batting .474 over his last seven games.</p>
<p>Tyler Skaggs also had a strong outing for the Angels, pitching six innings of one-run ball while striking out seven batters. The lefty has been one of LA’s most reliable starters this season, posting a 4.08 ERA in 17 appearances.</p>
<p>The Athletics got off to a fast start behind Davis’ home run, but ultimately couldn’t hold on against Trout and company. Davis went 2 for 4 with two RBIs on the day, but it wasn’t enough to overcome LA’s offense.</p>
<p>Oakland will hope to get back on track tomorrow night when they take on Garrett Richards and the Angels.</p>
<h1 id="Mariners-Fall-Back-M’s-can’t-keep-up-with-division-leaders"><a href="#Mariners-Fall-Back-M’s-can’t-keep-up-with-division-leaders" class="headerlink" title="Mariners Fall Back: M’s can’t keep up with division leaders"></a>Mariners Fall Back: M’s can’t keep up with division leaders</h1><p>It was a rough week for the Seattle Mariners. The team lost four out of six games, falling to third place in the division behind the Houston Astros and Los Angeles Angels.</p>
<p>The Astros continued their hot streak, winning all six of their games last week. The Angels also performed well, winning five of their six games.</p>
<p>The Mariners were held to just 11 runs over the six games. Nelson Cruz and Robinson Cano both struggled at the plate, with Cano recording just two hits in 21 at-bats.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mike Trout and Justin Upton continued to lead the Angels offence. Trout hit four home runs last week while Upton had five RBIs.</p>
<p>Houston’s Jose Altuve also had a strong week at the plate, batting .381 with eight RBIs.</p>
<p>Despite their poor performance last week, the Mariners are still in good shape overall this season. They have a record of 53-40 and remain just two games back from first place in the division.</p>
<h1 id="Rangers-in-Trouble-Texas-falls-further-behind"><a href="#Rangers-in-Trouble-Texas-falls-further-behind" class="headerlink" title="Rangers in Trouble: Texas falls further behind"></a>Rangers in Trouble: Texas falls further behind</h1><p>The Texas Rangers were supposed to be one of the top teams in baseball this year, but they have been anything but. At the halfway point of the season, they sit at the bottom of their division with a record of 33-49.</p>
<p>What has gone wrong for the Rangers? The biggest issue has been their pitching. Their team ERA is 4.57, which is third-worst in the league. They have also had trouble scoring runs, putting up just 3.7 runs per game, which is also third-worst in the league.</p>
<p>Some bright spots for the Rangers include Joey Gallo, who leads the team in home runs with 23, and Elvis Andrus, who is batting .302. But those players have not been able to make up for the lack of production from other players on the team.</p>
<p>The Rangers are currently in last place in their division and look like they will miss out on the playoffs for the second consecutive year. If they want to return to contention, they will need to make some major changes both on and off the field.</p>
<h1 id="Astros-Alive-Yet-Again-Houston-makes-late-move-to-stay-in-contention"><a href="#Astros-Alive-Yet-Again-Houston-makes-late-move-to-stay-in-contention" class="headerlink" title="Astros Alive Yet Again: Houston makes late move to stay in contention"></a>Astros Alive Yet Again: Houston makes late move to stay in contention</h1><p>The Houston Astros were seemingly done for after seven innings of play on Sunday,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> down 4-1 to the Seattle Mariners. But thanks to a three-run outburst in the eighth inning and an insurance run in the ninth, they pulled off a 5-4 victory to stay in contention for a postseason berth.</p>
<p>Houston is now two games back of the Oakland Athletics for the second wild card spot in the American League with just six games remaining.</p>
<p>The Astros’ offense has been struggling mightily of late, scoring just nine runs over their last five games. But they finally came through when it mattered most on Sunday, getting big hits from José Altuve, Yuli Gurriel and Alex Bregman.</p>
<p>Houston will need to fend off a surging Los Angeles Angels team over their final six games in order to make the playoffs. And while it won’t be easy, they’ve proven time and time again that they’re never counted out until the final out is recorded.</p>

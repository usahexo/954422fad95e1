<p>The all-cash transaction was worth $547 million, representing a multiple of approximately 11 times Adjusted EBITDA. MGM says that the purchase is part of its strategy to grow its regional footprint and expand its customer base.</p>
<p>“Red Rock is a perfect fit for MGM Resorts,” said Jim Murren, Chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts. “It shares our same commitment to delivering an exceptional experience and we look forward to welcoming Red Rock’s guests and employees into the MGM Resorts family.”</p>
<p>Red Rock Casino Resort Spa has been in operation since April 2004. The property features 2,752 slot machines, 178 table games, and a race and sports book. It also includes two celebrity chef restaurants, a spa, and 70,000 square feet of meeting space.</p>
<p>In total, MGM now owns or operates 26 properties in Nevada, including ten on the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<h1 id="Wynn-Resorts-Limited-completes-acquisition-of-Red-Rock-Casino"><a href="#Wynn-Resorts-Limited-completes-acquisition-of-Red-Rock-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Wynn Resorts Limited completes acquisition of Red Rock Casino"></a>Wynn Resorts Limited completes acquisition of Red Rock Casino</h1><p>Wynn Resorts Limited (NASDAQ: WYNN) announced on Tuesday that it has completed the acquisition of Red Rock Casino Resort and Spa from MGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM) for a total purchase price of $2.7 billion, including the assumption of approximately $1.3 billion of outstanding debt.</p>
<p>The all-cash transaction is funded with a combination of cash on hand and new debt financing.</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts Chairman and CEO Steve Wynn said, “We are excited to have completed the acquisition of Red Rock, which is an important addition to our company as we continue to grow our business in Las Vegas andMacau. This property is a natural complement to our existing assets and enhances our ability to offer guests a unique integrated resort experience.”</p>
<p>The acquisition expands Wynn Resorts’ Las Vegas footprint to 2,700 acres with the addition of Red Rock’s 109 acres. The purchase price represents an implied value of $24.75 per share for Red Rock’s outstanding common stock, representing a premium of approximately 34% to its unaffected closing share price on February 24th, the last trading day prior to announcement of the proposed transaction.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, MGM Resorts has the right to receive a termination fee equal to $100 million if the transaction is not consummated due to a material breach by Wynn Resorts or certain other events. In addition, MGM Resorts has agreed not to compete with Wynn Resorts in Las Vegas for a period of five years.</p>
<h1 id="Genting-Group-acquires-controlling-stake-in-Red-Rock-Casino"><a href="#Genting-Group-acquires-controlling-stake-in-Red-Rock-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Genting Group acquires controlling stake in Red Rock Casino"></a>Genting Group acquires controlling stake in Red Rock Casino</h1><p>Genting Group, a Malaysian conglomerate, announced on Monday that it has acquired a controlling stake in Red Rock Casino Resort &amp; Spa in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The move allows Genting to enter the Las Vegas casino market and marks its first foray into the United States gaming and hospitality industry. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Red Rock, which is located on the west side of the Las Vegas Strip, features 2,000 slot machines and 94 table games. The property also includes a 424-room hotel, a 10,000-square-foot spa and 12 restaurants.</p>
<p>“We are very excited about this new venture with Red Rock and believe that our respective strengths will complement each other very well,” said Lim Kok Thay, chairman of Genting Group.</p>
<p>The acquisition follows Genting’s purchase last year of a 40 percent stake in Atlantic City’s Revel Casino Hotel for $355 million.</p>

The purchase price is estimated to be around $4 billion, making it one of the largest deals in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>The move will give Caesars a larger presence in Las Vegas, and let it compete more effectively against MGM Resorts International. It’s also expected to result in cost savings for Caesars, as the two companies will be able to share resources.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to have reached an agreement with Station Casinos that delivers significant value to our shareholders and creates a stronger company with a leading position in Nevada,” said Mark Frissora, CEO of Caesars Entertainment.</p>
<p>The purchase still needs approval from regulators, but is expected to go through without any problems.</p>

<p>The move comes as LVS looks to expand its operations in Las Vegas. The company already owns the Venetian and Palazzo resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, as well as resorts in Singapore and Macau.</p>
<p>The Red Rock Casino is located about 10 miles west of the Las Vegas Strip and features 2,650 slot machines, 97 table games, and a 35-table poker room. The property also includes a 207-room luxury hotel, a 15,000-square-foot spa, and six restaurants.</p>
<p>LVS Chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson said that the purchase of Red Rock will provide his company with a “premier venue” in the western part of Las Vegas. He added that the acquisition will also provide LVS with “additional opportunity to grow our convention and meeting business.”</p>
<p>MGM Resorts International CEO Jim Murren said that his company is selling Red Rock “in order to focus on our core business in Las Vegas.” He added that MGM is still committed to its partnership with LVS at the Venetian and Palazzo resorts on the Strip.</p>

<h1 id="What-is-Congo"><a href="#What-is-Congo" class="headerlink" title="What is Congo?"></a>What is Congo?</h1><p>The Republic of Congo, more commonly referred to as Congo, is a sovereign state located in Central Africa. It is the second largest country in the continent, after Algeria, and has a population of over 78 million people. The capital and most populous city is Brazzaville.</p>
<p>Congo has a rich history and cultural heritage that dates back to the precolonial era. The region was first inhabited by Bantu people who migrated from other parts of Africa in the 5th century AD. The Kongo Kingdom was established in the 14th century and became one of the most powerful states in Africa. It declined in the 19th century following internal strife and colonial incursions by European powers.</p>
<p>Today, Congo is a republic with a presidential system of government. It is one of the poorest countries in the world, due largely to political instability, corruption, and economic mismanagement. However, it possesses significant natural resources such as oil, diamonds, and gold, which have contributed to its growth as an important regional player.</p>
<h1 id="Geography"><a href="#Geography" class="headerlink" title="Geography"></a>Geography</h1><p>The Republic of Congo is located in Central Africa, bordered by Gabon to the west, Cameroon to the north, the Central African Republic to the east, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the south. It has a total area of 342,000 square kilometers (132,000 square miles) and shares a 1,527-kilometer (947-mile) border with its neighbor to the north, Cameroon.</p>
<p>The country can be divided into two main geographical regions: The coastal lowlands or Bas-Congo in the west; and The highlands or Haut-Congo in the east. Elevation ranges from sea level along the coast to 2,440 meters (8,010 feet) at Mont Iboundji on the border with Cameroon.</p>
<p>The lowlands are characterized by swampy plains covered with rainforest and wooded savanna interspersed with rivers and lakes. The highlands are hilly and covered with dense equatorial rainforest broken up by occasional plateaus and mountain ranges. This region is home to most of Congo’s population and contains most of its natural resources.</p>
<h1 id="Climate"><a href="#Climate" class="headerlink" title="Climate"></a>Climate</h1><p>Humid tropical climate prevails almost throughout Congo with average temperatures ranging from 22°C (72°F) in Brazzaville to 25°C (77°F) in Pointe-Noire. The dry season lasts from June to September while rainfall peaks between October and April.</p>

        <h1 id="What-is-the-connection-between-Vegas-and-slots"><a href="#What-is-the-connection-between-Vegas-and-slots" class="headerlink" title="What is the connection between Vegas and slots?"></a>What is the connection between Vegas and slots?</h1><p>Slot machines account for a large majority of casino revenue in Las Vegas. In fact, in 2012, slot machines accounted for $6.8 billion of the Strip’s overall $10.5 billion in gambling revenue. This is likely due to their ease of use - players only need to insert coins or tokens and pull a lever or press a button to start playing. </p>
<p>Slot machines were first installed on the Vegas Strip in 1967 at the Dunes Hotel and Casino. The original machines were coin-operated devices with three spinning reels. Slot machines did not become popular on the Strip until the 1990s when casinos started introducing new versions with video displays and bonuses like free spins.</p>
<p>The popularity of slot machines has led to their installation in other parts of Nevada as well as in other states across the country. In fact, there are now more than 1 million slot machines across America.</p>
<h1 id="Why-is-Texas-famous-for-its-slots"><a href="#Why-is-Texas-famous-for-its-slots" class="headerlink" title="Why is Texas famous for its slots?"></a>Why is Texas famous for its slots?</h1><p>There are a number of reasons that Texas is famous for its slots. The first reason is that Texas is home to some of the most popular casinos in the world. These casinos offer a wide variety of slot games that are sure to please any player.</p>
<p>The second reason why Texas is famous for its slots is because the state offers some of the best casino bonuses in the world. These bonuses can let players gamble for free and potentially win big payouts.</p>
<p>Finally, Texas is also known for its great customer service when it comes to slots. If you have any questions or concerns, the staff at Texas casinos are happy to help. They will go out of their way to make sure you have a great experience at their casino.</p>
<h1 id="Who-was-Kofi-A-Annan-and-what-did-he-do"><a href="#Who-was-Kofi-A-Annan-and-what-did-he-do" class="headerlink" title="Who was Kofi A. Annan and what did he do?"></a>Who was Kofi A. Annan and what did he do?</h1><p>Kofi Annan (born April 8, 1938) was a Ghanaian diplomat who served as the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2006. Annan and the UN were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001 “for their work for a better organized and more peaceful world”.</p>
<p>Annan was born in Kumasi, Gold Coast (now Ghana). After completing his undergraduate studies at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, United States, he worked for the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1974, he became Director of Programme Planning and Coordination at the United Nations Secretariat in New York City.</p>
<p>From 1987 to 1991, he served as Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs. In 1993, he was appointed UN Special Envoy to Burundi. From 1994 to 1996 he was UN Senior Adviser on African Affairs. </p>
<p>In 1996, he was appointed UN Secretary-General by the General Assembly and confirmed by the Security Council. As Secretary-General, Annan reformed the UN bureaucracy; dealt with humanitarian disasters including the Rwandan genocide; sought to promote democracy and human rights; and spearheaded efforts to fight HIV&#x2F;AIDS and global warming. </p>
<p>Annan resigned as Secretary-General on December 31, 2006 following allegations of corruption linked to oil sales in Iraq by his son Kojo Annan. He returned to private life, working with The Elders group of global leaders and serving as the chairman of The Kofi Annan Foundation. </p>
<p>In September 2013, he was appointed co-chairman of steering committee of the Global Commission on Drug Policy. He died on August 18, 2018 after a short illness.”</p>
<h1 id="How-are-Vegas-and-Texas-slots-similar"><a href="#How-are-Vegas-and-Texas-slots-similar" class="headerlink" title="How are Vegas and Texas slots similar?"></a>How are Vegas and Texas slots similar?</h1><p>Slot machines are a popular form of gambling, and they can be found in casinos all over the world. In the United States, there are two main types of slot machines – those found in Las Vegas and those found in Texas. While the games may look different to the untrained eye, they are actually quite similar. Here’s a look at how Texas and Vegas slots compare:</p>
<p>In both types of slots, players insert coins into the machine and then pull a lever or press a button to spin the reels. The goal is to match up symbols on the reels to win cash prizes. The similarities between Vegas and Texas slots really begin to show when you look at the different symbols that can appear on the reels. In both cases, you will find symbols like cherries, bars, and bells, as well as more unique symbols like wilds and scatters.</p>
<p>One major difference between the two types of slots is that Texas machines typically have higher payouts than Vegas machines. This is because Texas law requires that all slot machines offer a payout percentage of at least 75%. In contrast, Nevada law only requires that casinos offer a payout percentage of 67%. As a result, Texas slot machines often offer players better odds of winning big money.</p>
<p>Another difference between Vegas and Texas slots is the way in which wins are paid out. In most cases, Vegas slots will pay out cash prizes immediately after players have matched up winning symbols on the reels. However, in Texas slots, players usually have to go to a designated payout booth in order to collect their winnings. This can add an extra layer of excitement to playing slot machines, as players never know when they might hit it big and take home a life-changing jackpot!</p>

<p>Annan was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001 “for his work for a better organized and more peaceful world”.</p>
<p>Annan passed away on August 18, 2018, at the age of 80.</p>

Every year, people flock to some of the most well-known tourist destinations on the planet to see ancient ruins, towering skyscrapers, and natural wonders.</p>
<p>What will be the top 25 tourist destinations in 2022? Here’s our list:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Great Pyramids of Giza, Egypt</li>
<li>Machu Picchu, Peru</li>
<li>The Colosseum, Rome, Italy</li>
<li>Petra, Jordan</li>
<li>Taj Mahal, Agra, India</li>
<li>Angkor Wat Temple, Siem Reap, Cambodia</li>
<li>Venetian canals and gondolas of Venice, Italy </li>
<li>Stonehenge, Wiltshire, England</li>
<li>The Ring of Kerry drive in County Kerry, Ireland </li>
<li>Bagan temples in Myanmar (Burma)  </li>
<li>Iguazú Falls on the border of Argentina and Brazil </li>
<li>Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 13 . Palace of Versailles near Paris, France<br>14 . Rocky Mountains in Colorado USA<br>15 . Niagara Falls straddling Canada and the USA 16 . Australian outback near Alice Springs Australia</li>
</ol>
<p>17 . Torres del Paine National Park in Chilean Patagonia   18 . Peruvian Amazon rainforest near Iquitos Peru 19 . old city of Jerusalem and its walls Israel 20 .

<h1 id="Which-landmarks-will-be-on-the-list"><a href="#Which-landmarks-will-be-on-the-list" class="headerlink" title="Which landmarks will be on the list?"></a>Which landmarks will be on the list?</h1><p>We still don’t know which landmarks will be on the list, but there are some spots that we can definitely rule out.</p>
<p>For one, there will be no casinos included in the renovation project. Officials say that the revenue generated from the gaming industry is not enough to cover the costs of restoration, so casinos will be left out of the equation. This means that Atlantic City’s iconic Boardwalk and casino hotels like The Borgata and Harrah’s Resort Casino will not be receiving any upgrades.</p>
<p>There has also been some discussion about whether or not The Steel Pier would be included in the project. Currently, it is still up in the air, as officials are still trying to figure out how to pay for its restoration. The Steel Pier is a major tourist attraction in Atlantic City, and it would be a shame if it wasn’t included in the redevelopment project.</p>
<p>So far, only a few landmarks have been confirmed for the list. These include The Trump Taj Mahal, Boardwalk Hall, and Convention Center. It is likely that more landmarks will be announced in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<h1 id="How-were-they-chosen"><a href="#How-were-they-chosen" class="headerlink" title="How were they chosen?"></a>How were they chosen?</h1><p>Choosing the lucky twenty was an arduous task. There were many deserving scholars, scientists and entrepreneurs whose contributions have advanced humanity. But alas, only twenty could be chosen.</p>
<p>The criteria for selection were based on the following: their impact on the world, their influence on their field of work and their dedication to philanthropy. Some of the finalists were also selected based on their unique stories or radical inventions which have shaped society as we know it today.</p>

<h1 id="What-criteria-was-used-to-choose-them"><a href="#What-criteria-was-used-to-choose-them" class="headerlink" title="What criteria was used to choose them?"></a>What criteria was used to choose them?</h1><p>There are a number of factors that go into the decision of which headphones to purchase. One of the main ones is what the headphones will be used for. If they will only be used for listening to music, then personal preferences and comfort are key considerations. However, if the headphones will also be used for making phone calls or working on audio projects, then sound quality is a much more important factor.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is price. Some people are willing to pay more for better sound quality, while others prioritize comfort and cost over all else. There are a variety of headphones available at a wide range of prices, so it is important to find the right pair for each individual’s needs and budget.</p>
<p>The last major factor that goes into headphone selection is whether they are meant for everyday use or special occasions. If they will only be used occasionally, then it may not be necessary to invest in a high-quality pair of headphones. However, if they will be used every day, then it is worth investing in a good pair that will last long and provide great sound quality.</p>
<p>There is no one perfect set of headphones that fits everyone’s needs perfectly. It is important to consider all of the different factors involved in order to find the best pair for each individual.</p>

If you’re looking for some ideas, here are some of the most unforgettable ones:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attend a writers’ retreat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many destinations around the world offer wonderful writers’ retreats that can provide you with an amazing experience. Whether you’re a novice or experienced writer, these retreats offer amazing opportunities to explore new places and get inspired. You can often find great deals on packages that include accommodations and meals, so it’s a great way to save money while enjoying a new destination.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Take a painting workshop.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you love painting, consider taking a workshop in a new location. Major cities often offer many different types of workshops, but there are also many smaller towns that can be perfect locations for painting workshops too. Choose a place with beautiful scenery or interesting architecture to really make the most of your experience.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Be a culinary tourist.</li>
</ol>
<p>Food is one of the best ways to experience a new culture, so why not try being a culinary tourist? Research local delicacies and restaurants before your trip and make sure to sample as many as possible during your stay. You might even want to try cooking some traditional dishes yourself – there are usually plenty of cooking classes available in tourist destinations.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do an art crawl.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re interested in arts and culture, why not do an art crawl in your next destination? This is basically just visiting as many art galleries, museums, and other cultural attractions as possible in one day or weekend. It’s a great way to see a lot of different things without having to plan too much ahead And if you’re feeling really adventurous, you could try doing an art crawl in more than one city at once!</p>
<h1 id="How-can-we-create-unique-and-memorable-tourism-experiences"><a href="#How-can-we-create-unique-and-memorable-tourism-experiences" class="headerlink" title="How can we create unique and memorable tourism experiences?"></a>How can we create unique and memorable tourism experiences?</h1><p>There’s no doubt that tourism is a big business, and one that’s only going to get bigger in the years to come. With people looking for new and exciting experiences, the tourism industry has been quick to adapt, with operators offering ever more unique and memorable tours.</p>
<p>So, how can you create a tourism experience that will be truly memorable? Here are some tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Think outside the box</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to tourism, there are no hard and fast rules – so think outside the box and come up with something truly innovative. Maybe you could offer a tour that combines different elements, such as history, culture and nature? Or maybe you could focus on a specific theme, such as food or wine?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Create an immersive experience</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the keys to creating a memorable tourism experience is to make your guests feel as though they are really part of it. So think about ways you can immerse them in the culture or environment of the place they’re visiting. This could involve anything from traditional ceremonies to local cuisine.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Make it personalised</li>
</ol>
<p>Another way to ensure your guests have a great time is to make sure the tour is personalised to their interests. Talk to them before hand and get a sense of what they’d like to do and see, then adapt the tour accordingly. Not only will this make them feel special, but it will also give them a more authentic experience.</p>
<h1 id="What-makes-a-tourism-experience-unforgettable"><a href="#What-makes-a-tourism-experience-unforgettable" class="headerlink" title="What makes a tourism experience unforgettable?"></a>What makes a tourism experience unforgettable?</h1><p>Tourism industry is growing rapidly. Every year, the number of tourists traveling to different parts of the world is increasing. People are drawn to the new and wonderful experiences that tourism can offer. So what makes a tourism experience unforgettable? There are many factors that come into play, but some of the most important ones are:</p>
<p>Authenticity</p>
<p>One of the main reasons people travel is to experience something new and different. They want to see, feel, and learn about other cultures. That’s why it’s so important for tourism experiences to be authentic. If visitors feel like they are being ripped off or that they are not getting an authentic cultural experience, they will likely not return. Authenticity can be found in many different forms – in the architecture and decor of a place, in the food and drink served, in the way locals interact with tourists, etc. It’s important for tourism businesses to do their research and understand what authenticity means to their target market.</p>
<p>Personalization</p>
<p>People also want personalization in their tourism experiences. They want to feel like they are special and that their needs are being taken into account. This can be done through attention to detail – from providing personalized itineraries to remembering guests’ names and preferences – as well as through engaging interactions with locals and staff. By making guests feel like valued individuals rather than just another number, businesses can create unforgettable tourism experiences.</p>
<p>Connections</p>
<p>Finally, one of the most important things for creating unforgettable tourism experiences is connections. People remember those special moments when they felt connected to a place or people in a meaningful way. This could be anything from feeling a sense of awe while looking at a stunning view to making friends with locals who show them around their city. When tourists feel emotionally connected to a destination, it becomes truly unforgettable for them.</p>
<h1 id="How-can-we-turn-typical-tourist-activities-into-something-more-special"><a href="#How-can-we-turn-typical-tourist-activities-into-something-more-special" class="headerlink" title="How can we turn typical tourist activities into something more special?"></a>How can we turn typical tourist activities into something more special?</h1><p>There are many activities that people traditionally do when on vacation, such as going to the beach, visiting historical landmarks, and eating at local restaurants. While these are all enjoyable pastimes, they can often become mundane after a while. Here are some ideas on how to make them more special:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Mix things up by exploring different areas. Instead of sticking to the same beach or area for every day of your vacation, explore new parts of town. This can add an extra level of excitement and variety to your trip.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try out unique activities. There are likely all sorts of fun activities available in the area you’re visiting that you’ve never tried before. Go zip lining, take a cooking class, or go white water rafting. You’re sure to have a blast trying something new!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Eat at interesting places. Instead of always eating at the same restaurant, try out somewhere new each time. This can give you a chance to sample lots of different types of cuisine and learn about new cultures.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take time to relax and enjoy the scenery. Sometimes it’s nice to just sit back and take in your surroundings without doing anything too active. Find a spot where you can relax and take in the beauty of your surroundings – whether it’s a park, a quiet beach, or a mountaintop view.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make memories with loved ones. One of the best aspects of vacations is spending quality time with friends and family members. Make sure to capture memories with them by taking photos, writing in a travel journal, or even making keepsakes like sandcastles or snowmen.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="What-are-some-creative-ways-to-explore-a-new-destination"><a href="#What-are-some-creative-ways-to-explore-a-new-destination" class="headerlink" title="What are some creative ways to explore a new destination?"></a>What are some creative ways to explore a new destination?</h1><p>When traveling, some people like to stick to the beaten path, visiting well-known and touristy destinations. However, there’s a lot to be said for branching out and exploring lesser known parts of a new place. Here are some tips for making the most of your travel experiences by getting creative with your explorations:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Do some research in advance about interesting areas or villages near your destination. Often these are the best places to explore because they haven’t been overrun by tourists yet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you’re doing a city break, take advantage of the fact that you can walk around a new place and explore its streets and alleyways. Get lost in the maze of neighborhoods and find hidden gems along the way.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try out different modes of transport when exploring a new destination. Rent a bicycle, go on a walking tour, or take public transport to get around. This is a great way to see more of the area and also get a taste for how local people live their lives.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When visiting natural destinations, get off the beaten path and explore areas that aren’t frequented by tourists. This often means getting lost in the jungle or hiking up steep hills – but it’s worth it for the unique views you’ll experience.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Consider alternative accommodations when traveling – like staying in a local villa or homestay instead of a hotel. This is a great way to experience life as a local and see some amazing hidden gems that you wouldn’t find otherwise</p>
</li>

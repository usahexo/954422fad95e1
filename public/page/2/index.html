</li>

</li>
<li><p>Organize food and drinks. You’ll want to provide plenty of snacks and drinks for participants and spectators alike. Try to keep costs down by arranging for catering services through local restaurants or grocers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have fun! The most important thing is to make sure everyone has a good time while raising money for a worthy cause. Plan some additional activities or games aside from poker so that everyone can get involved.</p>

<p>Finally, gold can also be used to purchase items in the casino’s gift shop. This includes everything from clothes and jewelry to gaming devices and home decor items. By using gold, players can get the items they want while also boosting their bankrolls.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a way to get ahead in your favourite online casino games, try using gold! You won’t be disappointed with the results!</p>

        <h1 id="Markor’s-whereabouts-unknown"><a href="#Markor’s-whereabouts-unknown" class="headerlink" title="Markor’s whereabouts unknown"></a>Markor’s whereabouts unknown</h1><p>It has been exactly two weeks since anyone has seen or heard from Markor, the world’s most beloved gorilla. The last known sighting of him was at the zoo in his home town of Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
<p>Since then, there have been numerous unconfirmed sightings of Markor across the country. Some people say they saw him walking down a busy street in Chicago, others claim that he was spotted at a primate research center in Atlanta.</p>
<p>The lack of concrete information has led to rampant speculation about what could have happened to him. Some say he may have been kidnapped and taken to a secret lab somewhere, while others believe that he may have simply run away from home.</p>
<p> Whatever the case may be, one thing is for sure - everyone is hoping that Markor is safe and sound, and will soon be back where he belongs.</p>
<h1 id="Where-is-Markor"><a href="#Where-is-Markor" class="headerlink" title="Where is Markor?"></a>Where is Markor?</h1><p>Markor is an open-source markdown editor for macOS, Windows and Linux. It is a lightweight and fast app that you can use to write your articles, essays and notes.</p>
<p>One of the best things about Markor is that it’s completely free to use. The app also has a built-in PDF export function, which makes it easy to create documents that you can share with others.</p>
<p>The user interface of Markor is simple and elegant, and it provides all the features that you need to write great markdown content. You can customize the font type, size and color, as well as the paragraph spacing. The app also includes a handy table editor so you can easily create beautiful tables of data.</p>
<p>Markor is available for download on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://markor.io/">Markor website</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Cleveland-casino-mystery-Where-is-Markor"><a href="#Cleveland-casino-mystery-Where-is-Markor" class="headerlink" title="Cleveland casino mystery: Where is Markor?"></a>Cleveland casino mystery: Where is Markor?</h1><p>In March of 2017, the Cleveland casino abruptly closed its doors with little explanation. The closure left over 1,500 employees without work and created a mystery as to what happened to the casino’s owner - Markor.</p>
<p>It was initially thought that Markor had absconded with the casino’s profits, but an audit revealed that the casino was actually in debt. This left many wondering where Markor could have gone and what he was planning to do with the casino’s money.</p>
<p>The FBI has since gotten involved in the case, and it is believed that they are investigating whether or not Markor is involved in any sort of illegal activity. However, no arrests have been made and no further information has been released to the public.</p>
<p>So far, all that is known is that the Cleveland casino mystery remains unsolved.</p>
<h1 id="Horseshoe-Casino-Cleveland-still-looking-for-Markor"><a href="#Horseshoe-Casino-Cleveland-still-looking-for-Markor" class="headerlink" title="Horseshoe Casino Cleveland still looking for Markor"></a>Horseshoe Casino Cleveland still looking for Markor</h1><p>The Horseshoe Casino Cleveland is still looking for a new marketing coordinator after the previous one, Markor, left in February.</p>
<p>According to casino officials, they are looking for someone with at least three years of experience in casino marketing. The ideal candidate would also have some experience in social media and promotional writing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the casino has been relying on its existing team of marketing professionals to help promote its products and services. This includes promoting special events, such as the recent $1 million guaranteed poker tournament.</p>
<p>The Horseshoe Casino Cleveland is one of the largest casinos in Ohio, with more than 2,500 slot machines and nearly 100 table games. It also offers a variety of dining options, including six restaurants and two lounges.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Markor-hiding-out-at-the-Horseshoe-Casino-Cleveland"><a href="#Is-Markor-hiding-out-at-the-Horseshoe-Casino-Cleveland" class="headerlink" title="Is Markor hiding out at the Horseshoe Casino Cleveland?"></a>Is Markor hiding out at the Horseshoe Casino Cleveland?</h1><p>There’s no definitive answer, but since the popular Markor software went offline late last month, some Reddit sleuths think they may have spotted it in the Cleveland, Ohio area.</p>
<p>On December 21st, redditor &#x2F;u&#x2F;rustythegeek posted a picture of an unrecognizable piece of software with the caption “New Markor?” This set off a firestorm of speculation in the Markor subreddit (&#x2F;r&#x2F;markor) and on other forums devoted to the app.</p>
<p>Some users pointed out that the unidentified program has many similarities to Markor: its color scheme, font, and layout are all strikingly similar. Others noted that the logo is different and that there are no user reviews or ratings for the new program.</p>
<p>To add fuel to the fire, a day after rustythegeek’s post, someone claiming to be a member of the Markor development team appeared in the comments section. They confirmed that a new version of the software is in development, but did not provide any additional information.</p>
<p>So far, neither developers nor users have been able to confirm whether or not this is an official update for Markor or a new program entirely. However, if it is indeed Markor, it would be a major development – especially given that the official app has been unavailable since December 19th.</p>
<p>Many users are eagerly waiting for more information and are crossing their fingers for an official announcement from either the developers or Reddit moderators. In the meantime, they’re jokingly calling Horseshoe Casino Cleveland “Markor HQ.”</p>

<p>The Star has been the country’s most popular casino for years, but developments on the Gold Coast could see it overtaken. The $3 billion Queen’s Wharf Resort is set to open in 2020 and is tipped to become the world’s sixth-largest casino.</p>
<p>The Gold Coast project is being spearheaded by James Packer’s Crown Resorts, which is also behind The Star. The new resort will include six hotels, three luxury resorts, a convention centre and 2,000 gaming machines.</p>
<p>The Star has responded to the challenge by making a number of upgrades, including a $105 million refurbishment of its Sydney Tower Eye attraction. The tower offers 360-degree views of Sydney and includes a 24-hour casino floor.</p>
<p>The Star also plans to spend $500 million on a new hotel and expanded gaming facility. However, analysts believe that the Gold Coast development could still be enough to unseat The Star as Australia’s top gambling destination.</p>
<h1 id="Gold-Coast’s-Casino-King-Hits-Back-At-Sydney’s-Threatened-Crown"><a href="#Gold-Coast’s-Casino-King-Hits-Back-At-Sydney’s-Threatened-Crown" class="headerlink" title="Gold Coast’s Casino King Hits Back At Sydney’s Threatened Crown"></a>Gold Coast’s Casino King Hits Back At Sydney’s Threatened Crown</h1><p>The highly anticipated $2 billion Gold Coast casino and resort development, promoted by Indonesian billionaire James Packer, has hit headlines this week after the nearby Sydney Crown casino threatened to block the project.</p>
<p>Crown Resorts, which is majority owned by Packer, has written to the Queensland state government warning that the new casino will breach the exclusivity agreement it has with its own licensees.</p>
<p>However, Gold Coast’s Casino King Hits Back At Sydney’s Threatened Crown, with a spokesperson for Mr. Packer’s company saying that “the exclusivity agreements signed by Crown in Sydney do not apply in Queensland.”</p>
<p>This public exchange between the two casino giants is likely to heat up as the Gold Coast project moves closer to completion, with a planned opening in early 2019. The spat could also impact on the finalisation of a revised gambling agreement currently being negotiated between Federal and State Governments.</p>
<p>In contrast to Sydney’s Crown casino, which is dominated by high-roller table games and poker machines, Gold Coast’s new development is aimed squarely at family leisure tourism. It will include a luxury hotel, 3 restaurants, a spa and 2 VIP gaming rooms.</p>
<p>The $2 billion price tag makes it one of Australia’s largest private investments ever and is expected to create thousands of jobs during construction and beyond.</p>

The casino offers a wide variety of games, including free slots no download 777, to keep players entertained all night long.</p>
<p>The Gold Coast Casino has been a staple on the Strip since it first opened its doors in 1990. The casino is known for its luxurious and comfortable surroundings, as well as its vast selection of games. Players can choose from a variety of Slots, Table Games, Poker, and more.</p>
<p>In addition to its many gaming options, the Gold Coast Casino is also known for its excellent customer service. Players are treated like royalty by the courteous and friendly dealers and staff. The casino also offers a wide range of dining and entertainment options to keep players entertained between games.</p>
<p>The Gold Coast Casino is one of the best options for those looking for a traditional Las Vegas experience. With its wide selection of games and comfortable surroundings, the casino is sure to please everyone who visits.</p>
<h1 id="Star-Casino-Pushes-Back-With-Plans-To-Take-On-Gold-Coast’s-Dominance"><a href="#Star-Casino-Pushes-Back-With-Plans-To-Take-On-Gold-Coast’s-Dominance" class="headerlink" title="Star Casino Pushes Back With Plans To Take On Gold Coast’s Dominance"></a>Star Casino Pushes Back With Plans To Take On Gold Coast’s Dominance</h1><p>The Star Casino has announced it will spend more than $2 billion to expand its Gold Coast presence, in a move that could see it take on the dominance of the nearby casino.</p>
<p>The Star says it will add a hotel, a theatre and new gaming and food options to its existing property on the Gold Coast. The expansion is expected to create 2,500 jobs.</p>
<p>The pushback comes as Crown Resorts prepares to open its $2 billion luxury resort on the Gold Coast, which is also expected to create thousands of jobs.</p>
<p>Crown’s resort is tipped to dominate the market, but Star CEO Matt Bekier says his company’s investment will ensure there is healthy competition.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to let Crown have a monopoly on this,” he said. “We’re going in there with guns blazing.”</p>
<p>Bekier said The Star’s expansion would cement the Gold Coast as Australia’s premier gaming destination.</p>
<p>Experts say The Star’s move is a wise one, given Crown’s impending arrival on the Gold Coast.</p>
<p>“Given that Crown is opening, The Star had no choice but to up the ante and make a significant investment,” said Dr Charles Livingstone from Monash University. “It’ll be good for the Gold Coast economy overall.”</p>

Both teams have had a great start to the season and will be looking to come out on top in this one.</p>
<p>The Sydney FC have been in impressive form, currently sitting at the top of the table with six wins from their opening seven games. They will be looking to continue this good form against the Gold Coast Titans, who have also had a strong start to the season.</p>
<p>The Gold Coast Titans have won five of their opening seven games and will be looking to maintain their good record against Sydney FC. They will need to be wary of Sydney’s attacking power though, as they have scored some impressive goals this season.</p>
<p>Some of the key players for Sydney FC include Alex Brosque, who has been in great form, scoring four goals so far this season. Milos Ninkovic has also been impressive, providing three assists and creating plenty of chances for his team-mates.</p>
<p>The Gold Coast Titans are led by Ash Taylor, who has been in superb form this season. He has already scored four tries and looks set to cause Sydney FC plenty of problems on Sunday night. Jarryd Hayne is also a key player for the Titans and will need to be at his best if they are to come away with a win.</p>

        <h1 id="MGM-Resorts-International-officially-owns-Red-Rock-Casino"><a href="#MGM-Resorts-International-officially-owns-Red-Rock-Casino" class="headerlink" title="MGM Resorts International officially owns Red Rock Casino"></a>MGM Resorts International officially owns Red Rock Casino</h1><p>MGM Resorts International has completed the purchase of Red Rock Casino Resort Spa from Station Casinos LLC.</p>
<p>The all-cash transaction was worth $547 million, representing a multiple of approximately 11 times Adjusted EBITDA. MGM says that the purchase is part of its strategy to grow its regional footprint and expand its customer base.</p>
<p>“Red Rock is a perfect fit for MGM Resorts,” said Jim Murren, Chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts. “It shares our same commitment to delivering an exceptional experience and we look forward to welcoming Red Rock’s guests and employees into the MGM Resorts family.”</p>
<p>Red Rock Casino Resort Spa has been in operation since April 2004. The property features 2,752 slot machines, 178 table games, and a race and sports book. It also includes two celebrity chef restaurants, a spa, and 70,000 square feet of meeting space.</p>
<p>In total, MGM now owns or operates 26 properties in Nevada, including ten on the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<h1 id="Wynn-Resorts-Limited-completes-acquisition-of-Red-Rock-Casino"><a href="#Wynn-Resorts-Limited-completes-acquisition-of-Red-Rock-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Wynn Resorts Limited completes acquisition of Red Rock Casino"></a>Wynn Resorts Limited completes acquisition of Red Rock Casino</h1><p>Wynn Resorts Limited (NASDAQ: WYNN) announced on Tuesday that it has completed the acquisition of Red Rock Casino Resort and Spa from MGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM) for a total purchase price of $2.7 billion, including the assumption of approximately $1.3 billion of outstanding debt.</p>
<p>The all-cash transaction is funded with a combination of cash on hand and new debt financing.</p>
<p>Wynn Resorts Chairman and CEO Steve Wynn said, “We are excited to have completed the acquisition of Red Rock, which is an important addition to our company as we continue to grow our business in Las Vegas andMacau. This property is a natural complement to our existing assets and enhances our ability to offer guests a unique integrated resort experience.”</p>
<p>The acquisition expands Wynn Resorts’ Las Vegas footprint to 2,700 acres with the addition of Red Rock’s 109 acres. The purchase price represents an implied value of $24.75 per share for Red Rock’s outstanding common stock, representing a premium of approximately 34% to its unaffected closing share price on February 24th, the last trading day prior to announcement of the proposed transaction.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, MGM Resorts has the right to receive a termination fee equal to $100 million if the transaction is not consummated due to a material breach by Wynn Resorts or certain other events. In addition, MGM Resorts has agreed not to compete with Wynn Resorts in Las Vegas for a period of five years.</p>
<h1 id="Genting-Group-acquires-controlling-stake-in-Red-Rock-Casino"><a href="#Genting-Group-acquires-controlling-stake-in-Red-Rock-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Genting Group acquires controlling stake in Red Rock Casino"></a>Genting Group acquires controlling stake in Red Rock Casino</h1><p>Genting Group, a Malaysian conglomerate, announced on Monday that it has acquired a controlling stake in Red Rock Casino Resort &amp; Spa in Las Vegas.</p>

The purchase price is estimated to be around $4 billion, making it one of the largest deals in the gaming industry.</p>
<p>The move will give Caesars a larger presence in Las Vegas, and let it compete more effectively against MGM Resorts International. It’s also expected to result in cost savings for Caesars, as the two companies will be able to share resources.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to have reached an agreement with Station Casinos that delivers significant value to our shareholders and creates a stronger company with a leading position in Nevada,” said Mark Frissora, CEO of Caesars Entertainment.</p>
<p>The purchase still needs approval from regulators, but is expected to go through without any problems.</p>

<p>The move comes as LVS looks to expand its operations in Las Vegas. The company already owns the Venetian and Palazzo resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, as well as resorts in Singapore and Macau.</p>
<p>The Red Rock Casino is located about 10 miles west of the Las Vegas Strip and features 2,650 slot machines, 97 table games, and a 35-table poker room. The property also includes a 207-room luxury hotel, a 15,000-square-foot spa, and six restaurants.</p>
<p>LVS Chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson said that the purchase of Red Rock will provide his company with a “premier venue” in the western part of Las Vegas. He added that the acquisition will also provide LVS with “additional opportunity to grow our convention and meeting business.”</p>
<p>MGM Resorts International CEO Jim Murren said that his company is selling Red Rock “in order to focus on our core business in Las Vegas.” He added that MGM is still committed to its partnership with LVS at the Venetian and Palazzo resorts on the Strip.</p>
